# pnaut-graph-utilities
Graph utilities for generating and verifying test graphs for the *PNaut* project

This project contains a set of utilities that were used for generating and 
verifying graphs used in the testing of the *PNaut* project. 

## Files
### generators/miyazaki.py
NetworkX extension that generates a Miyazaki graph and returns it as a NetworkX
nx.graph.Graph object.  For more information about Miyazaki graphs, refer to the
paper *The Complexity of McKayâ€™s Canonical Labeling Algorithm* by Takunari Miyazaki
https://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~miyazaki/piscataway.pdf

### generators/johnson.py
NetworkX extension that generates a Johnson graph and returns it as a NetworkX
nx.graph.Graph object.  For more information about Johnson graphs, refer to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_graph

### convert.py
This script is used for converting downloaded graphs in an edge list format to
a file format the *Nauty* and therefore *PNaut* can read.

### generator.py
Front end script for the NetworkX extensions listed above.  Calls the graph
generator, and writes the resulting graph to a file type *Nauty* and *PNaut*
can use.

### validation/
Files in the validation/ folder are used to verify the accuracy of the Miyazaki
graphs generated by this utility.

### requirements.txt
PIP requirements file, can be used to install the python modules required for this
project to function.
